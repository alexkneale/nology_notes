    "One of the advantages of working with Git is the ability to track changes to your files and roll back to any change needed at any point. Git does this by using tools called commits, which are snapshots of a code repository at a single point in time. When you make a commit to a git repository, you're creating another snapshot of that repository, which can be referred to or even rolled back to in the future. Rolling back simply means reverting the contents of a code repository to a specific commit, regardless of any changes that have been made since that commit was created. This allows for a large level of safety in a codebase.\n",

    "#### Last lab: Git and Version Control System (VCS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Three common types of version control are: local, centralized, and distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local\n",
    "\n",
    "Local version control can consist of something as simple as a naming convention. Examples: report_version_1.pdf, report_final.pdf report_final_final.pdf. It can also be achieved using specific tools to track file changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized systems allow client software to access and interact with the version control system. The server contains the history of the tracked files. Clients can check out specific files and versions. Changes made can be saved back to the server. While effective, these systems create a single point of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed version control systems consist of each client containing all tracked files along with their history. They mitigate the risk of a single failure resulting in a system outage. With all of the file versions available locally, the project can be worked on without network connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction to Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective Git use requires an understanding of Git's internal design. Git is essentially a distributed database used to create \"save points\" for files in a specific directory. Git calls these save points commit snapshots. Git uses the concept of snapshots as a mechanism for tracking file changes. Each snapshot represents the files inside a tracked directory as they were when the snapshot was created. Git allows users to go back to previous snapshots at any time. Snapshots chain together to produce a commit history by referencing the previous snapshot as their parent. Tracking parent commits enables one of Git's more powerful features: branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git stores commit snapshots inside its own object database. The database of snapshots and its supporting files is referred to as a Git repository. The contents of a Git repository reside inside a hidden directory named .git. The directory containing the .git directory is tracked by Git. All changes made to a Git repository are made locally until shared with a remote repository. Git commands check the current directory for the .git directory. If found, the repository is the target for Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Work Tree\n",
    "The work tree — also known as the working directory or working tree — refers to the directory on a local system where users interact with and make changes to files. This is where files and directories are created, edited, organized, and deleted. It contains the files for the currently active snapshot, while the Git repository stores the complete history of changes. The work tree is a regular file-system directory that is controlled by Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Index (Staging Area)\n",
    "The Git index — also called the staging area — is an intermediate area between the work tree and the object database. It serves as a holding area for changes that will be included in the next commit. The index provides control over which changes are converted into snapshots. It tracks modifications made to files in the work tree. Git creates commit snapshots based on the state of the files in the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking changes in the index enables Git to determine which files need to be included in a commit without scanning the entire work tree. This speeds up operations such as switching branches and snapshot creation. The index acts as a bridge between the work tree and the object database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Object Database\n",
    "The object database serves as content-addressable storage for snapshots. Content-addressable storage means that objects are identified and accessed based on their content rather than their location. Git objects are identified by a unique 40-character \n",
    "SHA-1 hash\n",
    ", opens in a new tab in hexadecimal format.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Git interfaces such as the CLI often accept and display the first several unique characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashes are calculated based on the contents of objects. Once objects are created and hashed, they cannot be modified. Calculating identifiers based on the contents ensures that content changes result in new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object database enables Git to store and retrieve commit snapshots, track changes, and maintain a detailed project history. Content-addressable storage and parent references ensure integrity, efficiency, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git combines smaller objects into a representation of a directory. This enables Git to reuse individual objects. Git uses the following objects to store snapshots of a directory at a point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git Objects\n",
    "Blob (Binary-Large-OBject)\n",
    "Represents the contents of a file and does not include metadata such as the name of the file.\n",
    "Tree\n",
    "Represents the contents of a directory and includes metadata about the contained blobs, such as file names and permissions.\n",
    "Commit\n",
    "Represents a snapshot of the files under version control and references a root tree and zero or more trees and blobs.\n",
    "Tags\n",
    "Represents a specific commit snapshot and indicates noteworthy commits such as a release milestone. Example: v1.0.0\n",
    "Git models the directory structure using tree objects. Trees contain a listing of file names and permissions. Files are modeled using blobs. Blobs contain the contents of a file. Combined these two objects model directories, sub-directories, and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram demonstrates the structure of a commit. Notice the directory structure closely mirrors the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Refs\n",
    "All Git objects — including commits — are identified with hashes generated based on the contents of the object. Using hashes to reference specific snapshots is not particularly user-friendly. Git allows users to create named references (refs) that point to specific commits — and other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refs are used to keep track of objects such as branches, tags, remote branches, etc. They provide an easier way to navigate specific commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref types\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are simply pointers to specific commits. The creation of a new branch creates a ref pointing to the currently active commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags are used to label specific commits as being important. Tags are commonly used for marking specific points in history as stable and unchanging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git includes several special references, such as the ref named HEAD. HEAD is essentially a symbolic reference to the current commit or branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote branches are refs that track branches for a remote repository. They enable users to synchronize local branches with the corresponding branch of a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git logs changes to refs inside the reflog. This includes branch creations and deletions, commits, etc. Log entries can be useful for recovering lost commits or undoing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refs provide a convenient way to reference specific commits or objects within a Git repository. They make it easy to switch between branches, tag important commits, and track changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Snapshots\n",
    "Creating snapshots requires a multi-step process. Git does not automatically produce snapshots for file changes. Git requires changed files in the work tree to be added to the index — or staged — before committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a snapshot is roughly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a change to one or more files in the work tree.\n",
    "Add to the index all changes desired in the commit snapshot.\n",
    "Commit the changes to the object database.\n",
    "Optionally push changes to a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The Git commands line interface includes two categories of commands: porcelain commands and plumbing commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has evolved over time to become the widely used software it is today. Git existed for several years as a collection of low-level (plumbing) commands before the introduction of the higher-level (porcelain) commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we mostly cover porecelain commands\n",
    "\n",
    "##### cd --> change directory\n",
    "\n",
    "cd content\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### git init --> initializes empty git repo\n",
    "\n",
    "The git init command created a new empty repository placing the content directory under version control. The content directory is now the work tree. Changes made to files inside this directory can now be recognized by Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git CLI commands check the current directory for the existence of a .git directory. Switching between repositories is accomplished by simply changing directories into another version controlled directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### rm --> remove\n",
    "\n",
    "rm 1.txt (removes file 1.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### git checkout --> can be used to checkout branch, but also to recover deleted file\n",
    "\n",
    "after running \n",
    "\n",
    "rm 1.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "can recover file by running (before you commit)\n",
    "\n",
    "git checkout 1.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "##### git diff\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to compare changes enables users to observe the exact nature of the changes. The git diff command is used to make different types of comparisons. This enables users to inspect changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official documentation describes the git diff command as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The git diff command is overloaded to be able to make multiple types of comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to compare differences can improve the overall Git user experience. The following section explores how to use git diff to compare changes in different states.\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding The Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The index — also known as the staging area — can be a common source of confusion for new users. The index is a data structure that sits between the working directory and the object database. It tracks changes made to files in the working directory before they're committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index contains a list of all tracked files along with details about the current state of each file. It tracks file metadata such as file paths, permissions, and timestamps. The index resides in a single binary file optimized for speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index allows users to selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit. Users can stage specific changes or files instead of committing all changes made in the work tree. This enables control over which changes are added to snapshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index enables an efficient workflow by separating the preparation of changes from the actual commit operation. Users can incrementally stage changes as they work on different aspects of a project. This promotes atomic commits and makes it easier to track changes, revert specific modifications, and collaborate effectively with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index helps to optimize the performance of Git operations. Staging changes in the index before committing enables Git to quickly determine the differences between the index and the current commit.

    "#### Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching creates isolated environments for making file changes. Branches start at a specific commit snapshot and create a divergent commit history. This enables users to simultaneously make file changes without interfering with the work of other users. This is commonly used for feature development and experimentation. Branching is a fundamental part of the Git workflow and is essential for effective user collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "All commit snapshots exist inside the context of a branch. Git repositories include at least one branch. Running the git init command created an empty repository with a single branch. This default branch is the same as any other branch except that it was automatically created by Git. Git used the name main in this lab because it was specified as a global setting. However, historically the Git-created initial branch has been named master.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Brief Aside\n",
    "Historically the initial branch created by Git has been named master. In this context, the word master is thought to refer to the branch, which is considered to be the master-copy for the repository; as in the canonical or primary branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a common theme in tech to use terms such as master and slave to refer to a primary and secondary system. The less descriptive terms master and slave are deeply rooted in humankind’s shameful history of human subjugation. In recognition of this fact, the industry has shifted in recent years to use the more descriptive name of main for the primary branch.\n",

    "\n",
    "Working in branches enables changes to be isolated from other branches. Eventually, branches will need to be combined to integrate changes. Git provides multiple ways to combine changes between branches. This step covers two options: merging and rebasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging and rebasing are two options for integrating changes from one branch into another. Merging is likely the most common option between the two because it doesn't rewrite the commit history. Rather it adds a new snapshot containing the combined changes. Rebasing is considered a bit more advanced due to the fact that it rewrites the commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "Git includes multiple merges strategies depending on the given scenario. The complexity of merging ranges from simple to complex. The simplest form of merge is a basic fast-forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "To demonstrate a fast-forward merge, some setup is required. The following steps set up a fast-forward scenario.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Merge conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe the merge conflict in the 1.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Git uses the markers: <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> to indicate merge conflicts. The marker starting with <<<<<<< HEAD indicates that the following section — down to the ======= marker — is from the current branch. The next section down to the >>>>>>> experiment marker indicates that change from the merged branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the order of the text is arbitrary; however, this would be more impactful with source code. Merge resolution may result in accepting the change from one or both branches.

    "Git includes a command line option used as an entry point for different merge conflict resolution tools. The git mergetool command serves as an entrypoint for one of the following tools: emerge, gvimdiff, kdiff3, meld, vimdiff, and tortoisemerge. These represent a mix of command line and GUI-based tools used for resolving merge conflicts. These can be useful when resolving multiple conflicts by paging through the conflicts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Keep your branches updated with remote branches (covered later in this lab).\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your changes in the branch you want to merge before performing merging. This helps to identify potential conflicts or issues that need to be addressed before merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review conflicts carefully to ensure the resolution is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep merges small and focused to help minimize conflicts and ease the resolution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide clear and descriptive merge commit messages that explain the purpose and context of the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test merged code thoroughly to ensure changes are successfully integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Push the merged branch to a shared repository for team member review once complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are general best practices. Specific project/team requirements may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that snapshots are based on parent snapshots. This produces the commit history and enables branches. Git provides users with the ability to rewrite the commit history using the git rebase command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The git rebase command is a powerful utility used to modify the commit history of a branch. It's commonly used to incorporate changes from one branch to another branch or to clean up and organize the commit history. The rebase operation is able to move, combine, and alter commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of rebasing is to take changes from a source branch and apply them on top of another branch. This creates a linear history by making it appear that the changes were made directly on the other branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING! Any mechanism that rewrites the commit history should be used with caution. See further details at the end of this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the feature_1 branch is behind the main branch by several commits. The command below compares the changes in the main branch with the feature_1 branch. Recall that the HEAD reference points to the currently active branch, which is currently main.\n",

Annotated tags are actual Git objects that reside in the object database. They include details such as the name and email address of the tag author. They include the date and time the tag was created and an optional message. These allow additional details, such as release notes, to be included. Tags are immutable, which ensures that tagged commits remain fixed and can easily be referenced in the future.\n",
